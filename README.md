# Predict Instacart Basket Challenge on Kaggle - Using RNN
Instacart Basket Prediction using RNN is a learning exercise taken up as a part of Deep Learning Coursework and the objective of this project is to apply Recurrent Neural Networks for the prediction task of the Kaggle Challenge.


## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will be referring to this work [Instacart EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/philippsp/exploratory-analysis-instacart) shared by a Kaggler to setup a baseline using our own base model developed from scratch using the skills learned in the class.

## Project Management
All the project management is done using this [Github project management](https://github.com/rem0temeth0d/instabasket_rnn/projects/1) tool.

## Notebooks
1. [**ProjectBaseline.ipynb**](./ProjectBaseline.ipynb) - This notebook contains the baseline code to be submitted as a part of Project Plan. Most of the collaboration would be done in this notebook.
